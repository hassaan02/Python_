#       Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# How I wonder what you are!
# Up above the world so high,
# Like a diamond in the sky.

# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# How I wonder what you are!

# When the blazing sun is gone,
# When he nothing shines upon,
# Then you show your little light,
# Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# How I wonder what you are!

# Then the traveler in the dark
# Thanks you for your tiny spark;
# He could not see which way to go,
# If you did not twinkle so.''')
