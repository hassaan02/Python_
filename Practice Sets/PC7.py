# 1. Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number using for loop. 

# n = int(input("Write a number to give its multiplication table : "))

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(f"{n} X {i} = {n * i}")


# 2. Write a program to greet all the person names stored in a list ‘l’ and which starts 
# with S. 
# l = ["Harry", "Soham", "Sachin", "Rahul"]

# l = ["Harry", "Soham", "Sachin", "Rahul"]

# for name in l:
#     if(name.startswith("S")):
#         print(f"Hello {name}")


# 3. Attempt problem 1 using while loop.

# n = int(input("Write a number to give its multiplication table : "))

# i = 1
# while(i < 11):
#     print(f"{n} X {i} = {n * i}")
#     i += 1
