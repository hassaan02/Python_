# Write a python program to add two numbers. 

# a = 5
# b = 7

# sum = a+b

# print("The sum of a and b is:", sum)


# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

# num = 444
# z = 66

# remainder = float( num % z)

# print("The answer is:", remainder) 


# Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.
# user_input = int(input("Type Something:",)) 

# print(type(user_input))


# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than 
# ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

# a = 34
# b = 80
# print(a>b)


# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.

# user_input1 = int(input("Type 1st no: ",))
# user_input2 = int(input("Type 2nd no: ",))

# result = user_input1 + user_input2 % 2

# print(result)


#  Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

# user_input = int(input("Type A Number: ",))

# result = user_input * user_input

# print(result)
